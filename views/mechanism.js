          The UTR uses the ideas proposed by Foucault to create an effective
          economy, achieved through the creation of arbitrary metrics for people
          to perform to. Algorithms can be used to design such metrics, through
          the use of classification and regression algorithms. Some examples of
          areas to which these are applied are care-based professions such as
          hospitals in which an algorithm ranks the performance of different
          staff and pulls up the worst performing be punished. Such systems are
          applied to all underperforming areas of society. The key takeaway is
          that these metrics can be entirely artificial, yet people will still
          perform to them.

          The government of the UTR is managed by an assembly of 100
          technicians. New members to this assembly are selected by an
          algorithm. This has been found to be the most effective way to
          eliminate human bias from the proceedings, humans being prone to bias
          which can be eliminated only through the mathematical objectivity of
          the machine. The algorithm selects people on the basis of both
          technical merit and the traits that the populous tell it are
          important. The government also incorporates elements of direct
          democracy; all citizens are permitted to table a motion before the
          assembly, which is then voted on. The assembly manages the country.
          There are several ways in which they do this. The first way in which
          this is done is the neo-Pavlovian conditioning of children. All
          children are brought up by the state, with the aim of ensuring that
          people are naturally cooperative and supportive of the ideals of the
          state. Although this is argued by our opponents to be a poor model
          which restricts individual choice and impedes challenges to the status
          quo, we feel that it is the only way that can guarantee the stability
          of the state. If the state where to collapse we would be left in the
          state of nature, in which all people would be fighting against each
          other – reducing overall happiness and with potentially disastrous
          consequences for the planet owing to the destructive weaponry humanity
          has developed.

          The structure of the UTR is pyramidal – at the top is the chair of the
          assembly who has power to call the assembly to meet and decides the
          order in which tabled motions will be brought before the assembly. The
          chair has no special powers over the assembly, i.e. they cannot force
          the passing of a motion. The chair has no power over government beyond
          those in his office. Below the chair sit the members of the assembly;
          they vote for and against motions tabled by members of the assembly or
          motions suggested by the population with the number of signatures
          greater than or equal to half a percent of the population. Motions may
          be signed electronically. Members of the assembly form working groups
          which oversee the operation of departments. Every department is lead
          by a randomly selected member of the assembly, who is replaced
          annually. Below the leader of each government department sit a ring of
          senior government officials who are algorithmically selected based on
          their meritocratic value. This value is determined based on the number
          of hours worked – although the algorithm factors this only into
          account upto a maximum of 40 hours average per week (minus holidays,
          parental leave or sick leave approved by a doctor) – as well as the
          quality of work. Below these officials sit the rest of the department.
          All departments are divided into a group of small cross-functional
          teams which work together to solve issues raised by citizens (via an
          online platform, the details of which are further down in this
          document) as well as other problems which they have identified.
        </p>

          The UTR requires a highly trained workforce which is achieved through
          lifelong compulsory education. Most education is done through MOOCs
          (massive online open courses, for instance Khan Academy) in which
          citizens are marked for the amount of learning they do as well as the
          percentage of questions they have answered correctly. Children must
          undergo a minimum mandatory amount of education, focused chiefly on
          science and mathematics. Some subjects are still taught by a human –
          mainly experimental-based subjects such as sciences where supervision
          is needed to ensure safety – but most are not, freeing up academics to
          pursue research which is of benefit to their field. All citizens are
          given a score, age weighted (taking into account periods of absence
          from learning due, for instance due to illness or mental health
          problems), quantifying the amount of learning they have done. This
          score can be used to match them to jobs algorithmically.

          When new algorithms are developed, they are first tested on designated
          test cities which are designed by the government to be representative
          of the wider populus. By using multiple of these cities it is possible
          to run statistical experiments which can show whether new algorithms
          work. These algorithms can then be rolled out amongst the wider
          populus. All algorithms are commissioned and written by the assembly.
          Algorithms are deployed on the state internet infrastructure. The
          state develops a centralised network for processing financial
          transactions, storing data and accessing media, upon which individuals
          can build services which must gain approval of the government to
          operate. This helps to ensure that all applications are safe to use.{" "}

          The UTR is by nature similar to the People’s Republic of China. The
          structure of the government is very Soviet, organised into small
          governing councils. The use of algorithms also mirrors China’s
          development. The PRC uses algorithms to track and monitor people. Much
          of this has been applied to the PRC. China uses algorithms for
          control, in some ways more sinister than others. Algorithms are
          applied to track and monitor the Uyghur muslims in the xinjiang
          province. Another application of the technology is to monitor people
          walking across the road during a red light and automatically send them
          a fine via WeChat. China also has a politburo, the central authority
          over which the chairman resides (Xi Jingping).
